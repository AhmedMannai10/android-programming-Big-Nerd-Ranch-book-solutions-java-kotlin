# Big Nerd Ranch Android Programming 3rd Ed -  Solutions to Exercises and Challenges in Java and Kotlin

While learning Kotlin I wrote the solutions of the book exercises and challenges both in Java and Kotlin.

As much as possible I have tried to keep same pace as the book chapter by chapter, and tried not to add new concepts ahead of time.
(Unless I could not resist and made sense in Kotlin).

This is not perfect code by any means. If you have improvement suggestions please contribute.
